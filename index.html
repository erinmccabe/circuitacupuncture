                <h2>Circuit Acupuncture</h2>
                    <p class="long-copy">Circuit Acupuncture LLC was founded by Erin McCabe, a Board Certified (NCCAOM) and licensed provider under the Minnesota Board of Medical Practice. The foundations began when Erin was working on an acute care Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) rehabilitation unit and was receiving acupuncture treatments. During her graduate training, Erin spent one year as an intern at Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Institute providing acupuncture services for inpatient brain and spinal cord injuries. The theory of looking at <span id="vision"></span>our body as one large circuit resonated and so Circuit Acupuncture LLC manifested.

                                <p class="long-copy">Acupuncture is the technique of inserting extremely thin needles painlessly into the skin at various depths along specific points on the body’s meridian system using single use sterile needles. An acupuncture session takes approximately an hour, starting with an intake interview by the acupuncturist. The first visit will take longer, as the acupuncturist needs to gather symptoms information and ensure the client understands the procedure.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="long-copy">In classic texts, Acupuncture dates back to 2,000 years ago in China. Back then, as there were no iron casting available at that time, needles were “made of stone.” Today, acupuncture is widely recognized by allopathic and alternative practitioners around the world as an effective complementary healing practice. The efficacy of acupuncture has been well studied and documented. (See research links.)</p>
                                <br>     
                                <p class="long-copy">Acupuncture can treat a variety of conditions. Overall, acupuncture is utilized to balance energy, ease pain, and help heal disease. Acupuncture is one of the fundamental techniques of traditional Chinese medicine. Acupuncture rebalances the energy flow, releases congested energy, and restores the body to its natural state of harmony.

                                <h3 class="subcat">Cupping</h3>
                                <p class="long-copy">Cupping is a therapy in which a “cup” is attached to the skin surface to cause local congestion through the negative pressure created by introducing head in the form of an ignited material. In this type of cupping, commonly referred to as “fire cupping,” the glass cup is transparent to control the treatment effectively. The cupping method has the function of warming and promoting the free flow of energy. This can be great for athletes, general fatigue symptoms, and pain syndromes.
